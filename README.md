# Beancount Fava MCP Server

An MCP server to interface with Beancount Fava.

## Installation

```bash
uvx @cookie223/beancount-fava-mcp@0.0.1 --fava-url=https://your-fava-instance/ledger-name

Sorry first release didn't have /ledger-name at the end of the URL. You will need it otherwise there is no /api endpoint.
